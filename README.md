# Introduction
[OceanSITES](http://www.oceansites.org) is an international collaboration, organized under [JCOMM](http://www.jcommops.org), and focused on collecting, delivering, and promoting the use of high-quality data from long-term, high-frequency observations at fixed locations in the open ocean. OceanSITES typically aim to collect multidisciplinary data worldwide from the full-depth water column as well as the overlying atmosphere.

This repository tracks the actions undertaken by the DMT focused on buidling and maintaining the distributed data system that supports the OceanSITES Mission.

Activities of the OceanSITES Data Management Team are mainly tracked using the  [Issue/Milestone](https://github.com/oceansites/dmt/issues) tracker and assigned to individual members of the DMT.
